I am a research intern supervised by [Prof. Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and at the same time I am studying at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I just finished my Computer Science Master degree at New York Univeristy Tandon School of Engineering. My current research focuses on the theoretical foundation of machine learning and data science, especially algorithm analysis and statistics. 

In my lesuire time, I like watching sports matches. I am an over 15 years tennis fan and sometimes watching basketball as well. Also, I like painting a lot, here is my deviant art page.
